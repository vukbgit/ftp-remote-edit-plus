# FOREWORD #
Based on https://github.com/h3imdall/ftp-remote-edit, I added the 'folder' concept:

 * you can manage folders from Packages -> Ftp-Remote-Plus -> edit folders
 * for each server you can select one folder from the dropdown list
 * folders are displayed in white into tree view in alphabetic order
 * orphan servers (not associated to any folder) are displayed after folders
 * change of folder name is propagated to associated servers
 * deleting folder makes children servers orphan

 TODO:

 * autoRevealActiveFile is disabled because it messes up at tree load time

 ## Special Thanks

 - [bhakta0007](https://github.com/bhakta0007) for several improvements
 
 Here is the original README content of the package I cloned and hacked:

# Ftp-Remote-Edit-Plus

Editing files on your server without the need for creating a local project. It is not necassary to download all files of your project.
Simply connect and edit your remote files. The files will be automatically updated to the server on saving.
